# How to Use:

Once the extension is installed, it will start reminding you to take eye strain exercises every 20 minutes, following the 20-20-20 rule. The rule suggests that every 20 minutes, you should look away from the screen and focus on something at least 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. This exercise helps reduce eye strain and prevents visual discomfort caused by staring at screens for extended periods.

When it's time for a break, a reminder popup will appear on your screen with a friendly message encouraging you to take a moment to rest your eyes. Follow the 20-20-20 rule during these breaks for optimal eye health.

To dismiss the reminder before the time is up, you can click the "Dismiss" button in the popup. The extension will continue to remind you every 20 minutes until you disable or uninstall it.

# Customization:

If you wish to customize the reminder interval or other settings, you can do so by editing the background.js file. Look for the setReminderAlarm function, where you can change the periodInMinutes to set a different reminder interval.
